			My name is Tanner Stephenson.<br>
			I was born in <b>Guelph</b> and spent most of my childhood living in Cambridge, on Glenvalley Drive<br>
			In my early teens my family moved to Halton Hills, to a house 15 minutes away from the closest city. <em>I was not happy about this fact.</em> We did get a dog though, so that was nice.<br>
			I enjoy reading and playing videogames. I find that <code>computer programming</code> comes naturally to me, and I enjoy working with databases.<br>
